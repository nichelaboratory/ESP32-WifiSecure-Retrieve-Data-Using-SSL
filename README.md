#Example of ESP32 retrieving web data using HTTPS/SSL

Here's how to connect an ESP32 to a website using SSL and download content using HTTPS. While trivial on other operating systems and programming environments, it's actually quite complicated to get working on the ESP32. After two frustrating days I managed to get it to work. In this example I'm using the WiFiClientSecure library and code sample. This is a wrapper on top of the widely used WifiClient library, so you should be able to get a wide variety of code samples working with SSL.
